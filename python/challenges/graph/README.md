# Graph

### Code Challenge #35
Graph Implementation

1. AddNode()
- Adds a new node to the graph
- Takes in the value of that node
- Returns the added node
2. AddEdge()
- Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
- Include the ability to have a “weight”
- Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
- Both nodes should already be in the Graph
3. GetNodes()
- Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
4. GetNeighbors()
- Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
- Takes in a given node
- Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
5. Size()
- Returns the total number of nodes in the graph


### Tests 
1. Node can be successfully added to the graph
2. An edge can be successfully added to the graph
3. A collection of all nodes can be properly retrieved from the graph
4. All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
5. Neighbors are returned with the weight between nodes included
6. The proper size is returned, representing the number of nodes in the graph
7. A graph with only one node and edge can be properly returned
8. An empty graph properly returns null
