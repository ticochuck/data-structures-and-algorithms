# Hash Table

### Code Challenge #30
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

- add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
- contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

### Tests 
1. Adding a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure
2. Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored
3. Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable
4. Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable
5. Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
6. Successfully hash a key to an in-range value

### Code Challenge #6

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
- .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

### White Board

### Tests

1. Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
2. Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
3. Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
4. Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
5. Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
6. Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list

## Code Challenge #5

## Description

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
    - Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
    -   Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
    -   Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
    "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

- Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.


## Tests

1. Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
2. Can properly insert into the linked list
3. The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
4. Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
5. Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
6. Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
7. Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list


## Usage

Start by creating a new LinkedList:
```
ll = LinkedList()
```

Then insert some values into your LinkedList
```
ll.insert('Saturday')
ll.insert('Friday')
ll.insert('Thursday')
ll.insert('Wednesday')
ll.insert('Tuesday')
ll.insert('Monday')
ll.insert('Sunday')
```
Then print the head value
```
print(ll.head)
```

returns:
Sunday, Next_Node=Monday, Next_Node=Tuesday, Next_Node=Wednesday, Next_Node=Thursday, Next_Node=Friday, Next_Node=Saturday, Next_Node=None

## Challenges

Writing tests is always a bit confusing.
